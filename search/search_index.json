That's why saffy was created, so that you don't have to come up with a data structure and architecture. So that you can concentrate on the fun and important part which is the analysis! When you come up with a solution you like, you already have it as part of the framework, so it is easy to use in the future.

The low and high tell us where to cut based on the tags. They are in seconds.
